## Overview

This course explores the expressive potential of computer programming in media production and provides a theoretical framework for interdisciplinary artistic practices that use generative systems in their creation including drawing, poetry, music, and video production.

### [Statement on Technology](https://community.itp.io/community_statement#technology)

> We pledge to center creative and ethical uses of technology in our research, teaching, and making. We accept the claim that technology is a reflection of society, its histories, and its politics. We reject the claim that technology is neutral and acknowledge that every technology has the potential to do as much harm as good. We acknowledge that when technologies cause harm, the harm disproportionately affects Black, Brown, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC), queer, trans, disabled, femme, low-income, survivors, and all other marginalized bodies and communities worldwide.
>
> With this understanding, it is our responsibility to center these groups when hosting, participating in, or developing events (e.g. workshops or meetings), materials (e.g. courses, syllabi, resources), technologies (software, hardware, tools, etc) and creative applications made within this classroom (e.g. works of art, products, installations, experiments, etc).

### Expectations and Class Manifesto

1. Be curious!
   - what questions are you asking?
   - what do you not know?
   - how can you find those answers?
     - exploring the p5.js reference is a great past time
2. Practice!
   - learning to code takes time!
   - you _will_ have to do a lot of work outside of class to understand what is going on in the context of your own projects
3. Low Stress **NOT** Low Effort
   - did you learn something new? write it in your documentation!
   - did you struggle? write it in your documentation!
   - did you accomplish what you wanted? write it in your documentation!
   - if you made a solid attempt and wrote documentation (via a discussion post) you get full credit!

---

### Class Format

Broadly – this is similar to a math class.

You will be taught in class:

- syntax of how the coding language works
- application of how to use the coding language in a broad sense

Outside of class:

- practice the syntax
- contextualize the content in your own projects

A typical week structure might look like:

1. Review previous week’s assignment and questions
2. Introduce new content
3. Practice new content in class
   - You should be following along the demos!
4. Apply new content in upcoming assignment

---

### Goals

1. Have a foundational understanding of Javascript through the p5.js library
2. Insight into how digital machinery operates and mediates socio-cultural patterns of life today
3. Understand specific software elements to manipulate data, such as variables and data structures
4. Create modular and repeatable code
5. Invent interactive works of art through the use of computer programming
6. Think critically to engage with the software around us.

## Course Requirements

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Grading | |
|---|---|
|Attendance and Participation	 |20%|
|Practice and Readings |10%|
|Projects |20%|
|Midterm |20%|
|Final |30%|

### Rubrics

Every assignment will have an associated rubric for grading. You can view this rubric in Brightspace by clicking on the assignment discussion post and "View Rubric".

### Responsibility

Students are responsible for all assignments, even if they are absent. Late discussion posts, failure to complete assignments, and lack of preparedness will jeopardize your successful completion of this course. Please regularly check your email for class announcements, GitHub for class materials and notes, and Brightspace for assignment due dates and submissions.

#### Attendance and Participation

Students are required to follow along with in-class demos and submit their work at the end of class for participation credit. These will count as your participation for the day. **If you do not have your camera on, or you are not present in class to follow along with the in-class demos, you will not receive full participation**.

**There are no excused and unexcused absences**. You are able to miss 3 classes before it starts impacting your grade. Two late attendances (meaning more than 5 minutes late) will result in an absence. If you miss a class, you are welcome to book office hours to make up for your missed participation for the day.

### Late Assignments

Any work is considered late if it is submitted after the due date posted on Brightspace. For every day the work is late, the student will receive a 10 % penalty. You are not allowed to resubmit late work for an updated grade.

### Extension Policy

Extensions are admitted on an as-needed basis, as long as _the student informs the instructor more that 24-hours before the assignment is due_. **_There are absolutely no extensions on the midterm or the final_**.

### Re-submission Policy

The instructor may request a student to resubmit assignments for full-credit. Please review your grades regularly to see if an assignment is requests to be submitted again and review feedback about specific changes to be made. Any resubmissions are due before the last class.

### Extra Credit

Extra credit will be offered on a rolling basis. Please see the related discussion post.

### Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tools:

For the first 7 weeks of this course I would highly encourage you to to _avoid_ using AI or any external tools (other than the p5 reference) in this class. We will cover effective use cases later in the semester, but you will find you can go much further executing your ideas when you have a solid understanding of the core coding techniques.

With this in mind:

- You MAY use AI in the initial stages of research, idea generation, and drafting.
- You MAY use AI for language translation.
- However, you MAY NOT not rely on AI output for significant portions of your final project form unless it is a necessary part of your project concept.
- If you use AI at any stage in the creation of your project (including initial stages, idea generation, drafting, language translation, and final form), you must properly cite and disclose this use. This should include details on the specific tool and version used, as well as the nature of your usage (for example, in programming code, images, and/or text/writing).
- Citation should reference both the platform and any creator (“style of”) names or references.
- Please follow [this citation guide](https://guides.library.harvard.edu/c.php?g=1330621&p=10046069)
- If you fail to disclose the use of AI, you will receive a 0 on the assignment.

2. [p5 reference](https://p5js.org/reference/)

**Recommended Materials**
I highly encourage searching for extra resources online, as long as you cite your sources in your documentation. Some places I encourage you to look at:

1. [The Nature of Code](https:// https://natureofcode.com/book/): a free online book written by Dan Shiffman exploring different physics applications in p5.js
2. [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/): A free resource to learn p5.js, created by Dan Shiffman. I will link these videos weekly so you can get a refresher on the materials.
